Cross 4 - player health and life, enemy health, item particle system

This update gives the player HP and a visible life bar, every time the player is hurt the bar goes down and if the life bar is depleted the player will be destroyed and will lose a life. The enemy also has health now. The items that the player can use to heal themselves also has particle effects to make it more visible to the player along with the enemies dissapearing when their health reaches 0.

The player has 3 green hearts displayed on the screen and every take the player takes damage one of the hearts changes to gray and if the player heals the color will revert. Enemies now also have health however the player cannot see it. The objects in the world have particles that make them easier to see.

In the next update glowing objects will be found in the world and will heal and assist the player with upgrades such as dashing and new weapons.
